\title{Integer sequence discovery from small graphs}

\begin{abstract}
We exhaustively enumerate all simple, connected graphs and compute a selection of invariants. 
Invariants sequences were checked against OEIS and updated/added if the database is incomplete.
We combined sequences to make new sequences and use this suggest relationships among the invariants.
We showed that we can readily visualize any sequence of graphs with a given criteria.
We released the code in a fully open-sourced manner allowing others to build off this work.
The work can be extended by considering other graph classes like trees or regular graphs.
