## Roadmap:

+ Document database structure here
+ Add a few invariants, easy ones that can be computed with networkx
+ Compute the database for N=10 over these invariants
+ Build the query maker
+ Write the OEIS checker
+ Check OEIS against combinatorical queries
+ Check set relations for _interesting_ queries
+ Add harder invariants and repeat!
+ Submit new sequences to OEIS
+ Writeup project as an experimental math paper (data mining integer sequences over graphs!)
